# HASS.Agent MediaPlayer

This <a href="https://www.home-assistant.io" target="_blank">Home Assistant</a> integration allows you to use your <a href="https://github.com/LAB02-Research/HASS.Agent" target="_blank">HASS.Agent</a> (a Windows-based Home Assistant client) as a mediaplayer device: see and control what's playing and play text-to-speech!

Need help? Visit the <a href="https://community.home-assistant.io/t/hass-agent-a-new-windows-based-client-to-receive-notifications-perform-quick-actions-and-much-more/369094" target="_blank">dedicated HA forum thread</a> or <a href="https://discord.gg/nMvqzwrVBU" target="_blank">join on Discord</a>.

Note: it won't be of much use if you don't have HASS.Agent installed & configured on at least one PC (or Windows based device).

Developing this tool takes up quite a bit of time. It's completely free, and it'll stay that way without restrictions.<br/>
However, like most developers, I run on caffe√Øne - so a cup of coffee is always very much appreciated!

Under active development; the new beta (2022.12.0-beta1) will be needed to actually use this. Hang on tight!
